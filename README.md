# Software Defect Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

Software defect prediction is a crucial area of research and practice in software engineering aimed at identifying potential defects in software systems early in the development process. By analyzing historical data and patterns, software defect prediction models can help software developers prioritize testing efforts, allocate resources efficiently, and improve overall software quality.


The primary goal of software defect prediction is to reduce the number of defects that escape into production, thus minimizing the impact on users and reducing maintenance costs. Various
machine learning and data mining techniques are used in software defect prediction, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. These models are trained on historical software metrics, such as code complexity, churn, and size, to predict the likelihood of a module containing defects.
